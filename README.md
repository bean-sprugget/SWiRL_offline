# SWiRL offline

## Overview

SWiRL stands for Scouts With Rocket Launchers. This version isn't really playable (although, neither is my other version) because it lacks online play, but otherwise the basic mechanics are there. The idea was: it is a 2D game with two players that can move around and double jump (hence the "Scout", from Team Fortress 2), platformer-style. They would then shoot rockets at each other (hence the "Rocket Launchers", also from Team Fortress 2). If their opponent was grounded, it would launch them in the air; if they were airborne, it would kill them.

## Installation and Running

First install the necessary modules, which is just `pygame`, by doing either `pip install [module name]` or `pip3 install [module name]`.

Install `game.py` and run it by typing `python [file]` or `python3 [file]` in PowerShell.
